# War-Card-Game-App
This is a game I created in Xcode based on the popular card game called War. It is an ios app coded in Swift. 
I made this game in order to learn how to make an iphone app, familiarize myself with Xcode, and to play with Swift. 
This was a fantastic learning opportunity. The next goal I have is to deploy the app, and I am trying to find the best method to do so.
